<h1>Updating files with a Python algorithm</h1>
As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate programme I was given the opportunity to learn and practise coding with Python. I was taught fundamental coding such as iterative statements and parsing as well as how to combine codes to create algorithms. The attached file shows how I automated the updating of a file whenever conditions changed. The entire experience of using Python was very enjoyable and interesting and has made me eager to enhance my knowledge and skills to create more complex algorithms in the future.
